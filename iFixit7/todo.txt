free images when leaving page! runs out of memory eventually...
	each guide tries to dump its cache when it is navigated away from. Cant tell if it works though

if you navigate to a col, then go right or left and select a device. when you go back, it navigates back to the col you originally navigated to, not
				the one you left. IE the back stack remembers the correct column, but then we manually navigate away from it
	has this changed? seems to remember each you choose now?

need to strip HTML (from links, which are usually relative and broken anyway) and un-HTML encode special characters
	reflection to find all strings would be best, but I dont have that working yet
	The methods to properly sanatize are in place though (in JSONInterface2.cs)



wishlist;
users
making guide text colored (or have some other colored marker) to match image labels
	color is already retreived, just need to translate to C# colors and set them
detect if no network and fail
some sort of local cache
open images in browser window or something to zoom in [open in embedded browser?]
new icon?
new background on main page? (that high resolution hammer image?)
