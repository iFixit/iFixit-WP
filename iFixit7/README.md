Official iFixit Windows Phone App
=================================
This is a native Windows Phone guide viewer built using iFixit’s public APIs (www.ifixit.com/api/1.0/doc)

CONTRIBUTING
============
This app is a native Windows Phone version of the iFixit website. We offer native browsing of our guides as well as integrated web views of our site with Answers and our Cart.

We have a small development team, and don’t have the resources to do all of these ourselves. We’d love help! If any of those problems looks interesting to you, fork our code and hack away!

Got an awesome feature idea that we don’t have an API to support yet? Post the request on meta.ifixit.com and we’ll add it to our to-do list.
