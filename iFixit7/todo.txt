on guide page
free images when leaving page!!!!! runs out of memory....
	i helped it i think? but when guides have too many images it explodes...
	
seems to always select the bottom item in a list of devices...? do i ever allow it to do anything else? delegates?
	works fine on the top level, so is it just selecting from the list of devices?
	when you select a device from a valid list of devices, it selects bottom
	
	swapping to next area being n seemed to fix this? nope? but n is correct
	
cant deal with variable depth hierarchy...
	need to be able to detect leaves, and ONLY THEN call deviceInfo! else just another magic pivot
	if there are specific devices AND catagories on the same level, need to be able to handle both
	
	phone > cell phone > nokia phone | selects 1 device, needs to show another magic pivot
	game console > microsoft game console > microsoft TV console | needs to show magic pivot with xbox, 360, etc. instead is one level too far

make device info (and guide?) into pano, not pivot

fix navigation on guide page not going to correct device if you go back



wish;
users
making guide text colored or something to match image labels
detect if no network and fail
some sort of local cache
open images in browser window or something to zoom in [open in embedded browser?]
new icon?
new background on main page? (that high rez hammer?)
