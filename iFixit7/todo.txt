free images when leaving page! runs out of memory....
	i helped it i think? but when guides have too many images it explodes...
	for instance, the boxee box teardown

if you navigate to a col, then go right or left and select a device. when you go back, it navigates back to the col you originally navigated to, not
				the one you left. IE the back stack remembers the correct column, but then we manually navigate away from it
	has this changed? seems to remember each you choose?

on guide page:
tools
prereqs
background? tab title?

make device info (and guide?) into pano, not pivot

fix navigation on guide page not going to correct device if you go back



wish;
users
making guide text colored or something to match image labels
detect if no network and fail
some sort of local cache
open images in browser window or something to zoom in [open in embedded browser?]
new icon?
new background on main page? (that high rez hammer?)
